        <p  style="font-style: italic;"class="outset">“Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank
        with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows
        neither victory nor defeat.” ― Theodore Roosevelt</p>
        <hr style="width:50%; height:2px; color:gray;background-color:gray">
        <p style="text-align:center; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:larger;">Here are a few things about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">I created an eCommerce store that allowed me to pay for college and travel. I <strong> sold over 20,000 </strong> products bringing in a
            steady income.</li>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">I <strong> quit college </strong> because I could not figure out what direction I wanted to take and I was paying for out of pocket. I was
            having trouble figuring out what to do.</li>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">I spend 3 years as a promo model for trade shows, music festivals (Coachella), and conventions (Comic Con)</li>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">I started a business as a broker for telecom, energy, and merchant services. I learned <strong> public speaking, sales
            negotiation</strong>, and the importance of <strong>personal development.</strong></li>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">2017 was the year that I officially became a <strong>female in tech</strong>. I earned a scholarship to an IT boot-camp. I attained my
            certifications and started my career.</li>
            <li style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">Within one year I had reached my goal to be in <strong>Information Security.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="one" style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">I mention all this here, just to clarify that when I talk about business and being a female in tech, I do so from <strong>actual
        experience.</strong></p>
        <p class="two" style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>My basic philosophy is all about developing the right mindset not just technical skills they can only get you so far.</strong></p>
        <hr style="width:50%; height:2px; color:gray;background-color:gray">
        <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">What is this website about?</h2>
        <p class="three" style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">The foundation of any success is having the proper mindset, character, and work ethic. Having the techniques, tools, and
        skills are just not enough. You cannot start a successful career in tech without developing the proper mindset to
        fortify your mind. This site is to <strong>empower women in tech</strong> by sharing the marketing and business strategies needed along
        with developing the proper mindset to become a bulletproof female in tech.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Least Likely to Succeed: My Story</h2>
        <p class="three"
            style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">
        I was born in in a third world country, raised by immigrant parents, and did not know a lick of English when I arrived
        to the U.S. at the age of 4. Growing up I did not have the opportunities that those who are born in the country do such
        as getting a job, a drivers license, and a financed college education. I felt like the odds were stacked against me
        because I was not a U.S. citizen.</p>
            <hr style="width:50%; height:2px; color:gray;background-color:gray">

                    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Life After High School</h2>
                    <p class="three"
                        style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">
                    In 2010 I graduated high school. I was deeply depressed, unhappy, and hopeless. I had <strong>no future</strong> and would never amount
                    to anything in life. While my classmates were attending college, landing great jobs, and dating I was sleeping my days
                    away just to escape from reality. I felt like I was stuck in a mental nightmare constantly thinking: how will I make
                    money if I can't even get a job? What will I do for the rest of my life? Will I ever have a normal life? What is the
                    point of being in this country if I can not do anything? Why was I even born? I'd never been so lost and afraid.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">A Blessing In Disguise</h2>
                        <p class="three"
                            style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">
                            I purchased an Xbox gaming console at a really good price from Craigslist that came with all sorts of video games,
                            controllers, and gear but to my surprise it was actually broken. The console had the infamous red ring of death
                            (basically the console had overheated). I purchased a defective console. <strong>I had been scammed.</strong> I was infuriated. I had
                            spent the little money I did have on a defective console. After several attempts to contact the seller with no response
                            I decided to do research and see if I could fix it. With the help of my dad I was able to successfully fix the console
                            and sell it along with all the gear for 4x the amount that I purchased it for.</p>
                                <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Then I Thought Of Something Could Do</h2>
                                <p class="three"
                                    style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                    I could start a business. From this event a business idea had been born. I bought Xbox consoles that had the same
                                    problem, fix them, and flip them for a profit. I started an eCommerce store which meant I could pay for college and
                                    actually have a shot at life. Having a business meant I had control over my future. For once life was looking promising.</p>

                                                                    style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                                            I quickly encountered a bottleneck in fixing and reselling Xbox consoles: me! It was very time consuming process in
                                                            fixing Xbox consoles. Plus profit margins had dwindled when new Xbox versions were released. I transition my eCommerce
                                                            store to a drop-shipping model. By this point my store was doing very well. I used the money from my eCommerce store to
                                                            fund for college with no real idea on what I wanted to study. After some time of only taking electives I stopped
                                                            attending college until I knew what I wanted to study.</p>

                                                            During this time I began promo modeling at trade shows such as SEMA, CES, ASD throughout the west coast. I would use my
                                                            lunch breaks to roam the trade-show floor to gather free gadgets and meet the business owners behind them. I was amazed
                                                            by all latest tech gadgets, cars, and products. I was inspired by all the different types of business ideas and
                                                            opportunities. This period of time taught me <strong>how marketing works, brand development, and how to speak confidently to
                                                            strangers.</strong> I spoke to small business owners and trade-show attendees. I was curious to learn the story behind these
                                                            successful products, the business owners, and how the business functioned. I took a couple of them out for lunch and
                                                            picked their brains. Their stories inspired me. <strong>But most importantly it gave me hope.</strong></p>

                                                            It is said that people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. The fear of public speaking is very
                                                            real. I partnered with a telecom company that recently had expanded to Latin America. I opened a business under them as
                                                            a broker for their services. The company was set up as teams and out of my team I was the only one who spoke fluent
                                                            Spanish. Therefore, I was the only one who could carry out the business presentations.
                                                            
                                                            I spent countless hours reading books about sales, public speaking, and marketing. I joined Toastmaster groups and even
                                                            signed up for Improv. I figured that if I could embarrass myself on stage then maybe the pain of public speaking would
                                                            not be so bad. I immersed myself in personal development and the success stories of others to strengthen my mindset.
                                                            
                                                            This venture proved to me that I was capable of more than what I ever thought I was capable. It ignited a hunger for

                                                            I did not choose tech, it choose me. I found an ad on Craigslist for a scholarship opportunity to attend an IT
                                                            boot-camp. I knew nothing about tech especially about Information Security. I didn't even know Information Security
                                                            existed! I had a friend that was already in the tech field working in Information Security. He sparked my curiosity and
                                                            interest for the field. I saw how successful he was without earning a college degree, he worked from home, and earned
                                                            six figures. But what really caught my eye was that I could use my curiosity for learning in an ever changing always
                                                            evolving industry filled with problems to solve. This has created such a high demand for more people to enter the field
                                                            giving me the opportunity to use my work ethic to squeeze in without needing a degree.
                                                            
                                                            After several interviews I earned the scholarship for the IT boot-camp and I jumped in head first. I spend my days
                                                            coding, taking computers apart, and studying for my certifications. Even after countless of hours, long nights, and
                                                            weekends of studying I still managed to <strong>fail at my first attempt</strong> at the certificate exam. I went in for a second shot, I
                                                            passed, and graduated from the IT tech boot-camp. This experience really challenged me especially because I had no prior

                                                            I knew since day one of my tech journey that I wanted to be in Information Security. I spent my weekends setting up
                                                            virtual machines with vulnerability scanners, setting up servers, and studying for my security certification. I did my

                                                            in and pick their brains. I did this with every job I had. I was constantly learning.
                                                            
                                                            Then finally <strong>after one year</strong> in the tech industry I landed my first job in Information Security. I could not believe it.

                                                            Throughout my tech journey I could not help to always notice how I was always the only female in the room. I stood out
                                                            like a sore thumb in every way possible. I knew since day one that this would be the case. But I also knew that this was
                                                            my slight edge. Along my journey I documented the struggles, fears, and experiences that I faced because I knew that it
